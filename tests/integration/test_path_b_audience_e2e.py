"""End-to-end integration test for Path B (BuyerDealFlow + channel-crew).

Bead ar-6ipo / proposal §6 row 20 -- the buyer-side end-to-end test for
the two non-CampaignPipeline deal-finding entry points identified in
proposal §5.3:

  - **Path B1: BuyerDealFlow / BuyerDealFlow** -- the brief-driven flow
    that materializes a seller-bound DealRequest payload.
  - **Path B2: direct channel-crew invocation** -- the demo/test path
    via ``kickoff_channel_crew_with_audience``.

The seller side is **mocked** in this bead because §8/§9/§10/§11 (seller
audience capability surfaces) are still pending. The mock seller is
"responsive but ignorant of new audience semantics" -- it accepts deal
requests and returns plausible deal IDs without actually matching
against the audience plan. That's enough to exercise the buyer-side
plumbing end to end.

Scenarios per bead deliverable:

  1. Brief -> planner -> DealRequest happy path with a 3-type plan
     (Standard primary + Contextual constraint + Agentic extension).
     Asserts the materialized DealRequest carries the expected
     ``audience_plan_id``.
  2. Legacy ``list[str]`` brief migration through the path. Asserts
     ``source="inferred"`` propagates to the seller-bound payload.
  3. Audience plan survives serialization at the flow -> seller
     boundary (mock seller endpoint, capture the payload, deserialize,
     confirm ``audience_plan_id`` parity).
  4. Capability degradation scenario (mocked seller) -- confirms the
     scenario is reachable. Actual ``degrade_plan_for_seller`` lives in
     bead §12, still pending.
  5. Pre-set ``state.audience_plan`` precedence (BuyerDealFlow only):
     a parent pipeline pre-seeds the plan; BuyerDealFlow does NOT
     re-run the planner.
