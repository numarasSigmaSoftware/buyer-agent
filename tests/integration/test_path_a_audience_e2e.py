"""End-to-end integration test for Path A (CampaignPipeline).

Bead ar-lk23 / proposal §6 row 16 -- the buyer-side end-to-end test for
the brief-driven CampaignPipeline path identified in proposal §5.3:

    Path A: CampaignPipeline.ingest_brief -> plan_campaign -> execute_booking

The seller side is **mocked**: a MultiSellerOrchestrator stand-in captures
the InventoryRequirements / DealParams that the pipeline forwards, so we
can assert the full typed AudiencePlan (Standard primary + Contextual
constraint + Agentic extension) survives every stage and arrives at the
seller-facing boundary intact.

Part 1: fixtures + happy-path scenario.
Part 2 (this commit): adds three more scenarios:
  - Capability degradation against a legacy-default seller. Builds a real
    `MultiSellerOrchestrator` wired to a recording capability client +
    mocked deals client to exercise the actual `degrade_plan_for_seller`
    + audit-log emission path with the same 3-type plan content.
  - Hard-reject when the seller's standard taxonomy version doesn't
    cover the plan and `audience_strictness.primary=required`. Confirms
    the orchestrator surfaces the seller in
    `DealSelection.incompatible_sellers` (no booking attempted).
  - Cross-repo AudiencePlan JSON round-trip: builds a typed plan in the
    buyer, serializes to JSON, reconstructs through the seller's
    `AudienceRef` model, asserts byte-equivalent (sort_keys) round-trip.
    Schema-drift backstop -- the seller's own ucp.AudiencePlan has a
    different (legacy UCP) shape, so the round-trip is exercised at the
    AudienceRef level for primary + each constraint + each extension.
