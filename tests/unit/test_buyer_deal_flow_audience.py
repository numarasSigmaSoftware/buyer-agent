"""Tests for AudiencePlan threading through BuyerDealFlow (Path B).

Bead ar-ts30 §18 -- Path B of the Audience Planner wiring. Verifies the
deal-flow path (`BuyerDealFlow`, the renamed BuyerDealFlow) invokes the
same Audience Planner step that ``CampaignPipeline`` (Path A) uses, and
that the resulting ``AudiencePlan`` survives every flow stage and rides
on the seller-bound ``DealRequest`` payload.

Coverage (per bead deliverable):

1. Brief -> deal pipeline produces a plan via the audience planner step.
2. Explicit-typed brief preserved through BuyerDealFlow (no mutation).
3. Legacy list[str] brief migrated correctly through BuyerDealFlow.
4. AudiencePlan survives BuyerDealFlow -> seller boundary (mocked).
5. End-to-end audience_plan_id stable through BuyerDealFlow stages.
