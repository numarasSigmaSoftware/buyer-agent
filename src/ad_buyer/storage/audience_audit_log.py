"""Append-only audit trail for audience-plan lifecycle events.

Implements proposal §5.7 + §6 row 13a:

> Audit-trail surface for degradation events -- every plan degradation,
> capability rejection, and snapshot-honor decision lands in a structured
> log keyed by `audience_plan_id`. Required for the §7 silent-degradation
> mitigation.

The log lives in a single SQLite table, `audience_audit_log`, with one row
per event:

    (plan_id TEXT, event_type TEXT, payload_json TEXT, created_at TEXT)

Append-only by contract -- callers only `log_event` (insert) and `get_events`
(read). There is no update or delete path. The table schema lives in
`storage.schema.AUDIENCE_AUDIT_LOG_TABLE` and is created idempotently on
every `initialize_schema` call, so older buyer DBs gain the table on first
boot after this bead lands without an explicit migration.

Event types (per proposal §5.7):
  - "degradation"           -- one event per `degrade_plan_for_seller` call
                               that produced a non-empty log
  - "capability_rejection"  -- seller returned `audience_plan_unsupported`
  - "snapshot_honor"        -- fulfillment honored a frozen snapshot
                               vs. current capabilities (mostly a §11/§16
                               hook on the seller-response path; the helper
                               is here so the buyer side can emit when the
                               seller surfaces snapshot info on the wire)
  - "preflight_cache"       -- capability cache hit/miss (optional, lower
                               priority; helper supports it for §13)

Payload is a free-form JSON dict so we can grow event types without
schema changes. Helpers serialize Pydantic models cleanly via
`model_dump(mode="json")` and accept plain dicts as well.

Bead: ar-q2uh (proposal §5.7 + §6 row 13a).
