"""End-to-end campaign pipeline: brief in -> plan -> book -> ready.

Orchestrates the full campaign lifecycle from a JSON brief to booked
deals with a READY campaign.  Integrates:

  - CampaignBrief (buyer-80k): brief parsing and validation
  - CampaignStore (buyer-0u9): campaign state persistence
  - MultiSellerOrchestrator (buyer-8ih): multi-seller deal booking
  - EventBus (buyer-ppi): lifecycle event emission

Pipeline stages:
  1. ingest_brief   -- Parse brief, create campaign in DRAFT
  2. plan_campaign  -- Transition to PLANNING, produce channel plans
  3. execute_booking -- Transition to BOOKING, orchestrate deals per channel
  4. finalize       -- Transition to READY
  5. run            -- End-to-end convenience method
