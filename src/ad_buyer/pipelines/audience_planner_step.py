"""Audience Planner pipeline step (full reasoning loop).

Wires the Audience Planner agent (`agents/level3/audience_planner_agent.py`)
into `CampaignPipeline` between brief ingestion and orchestrator handoff
per proposal §5.3 / bead ar-fgyq §6, and now drives the full reasoning
loop per proposal §5.5 / bead ar-9u25 §7.

Design:
- The pure-Python reasoning core lives in `audience_planner_reasoning.py`
  so it is testable without spinning up CrewAI. This module is the
  orchestration shell: it (a) builds the planner agent with its 5 tools,
  (b) wires those tools into the reasoning function, and (c) returns the
  plan + agent for downstream introspection.
- The CrewAI agent is constructed but not currently kicked off as a
  Task; the reasoning loop is deterministic Python. A future bead may
  hand the rationale prose generation to the agent, but the
  classification + role assignment stays here so tests stay
  deterministic.
- Anything the planner ADDS to a user-supplied plan carries
  `source="inferred"` so the audit trail (proposal §13a) can
  distinguish user-attributed vs. agent-attributed refs.

      3. Return the composed plan, agent, and rationale.

    The reasoning loop:
      - Preserves an explicit primary verbatim (user-attributed); the
        planner only ADDs constraints / extensions and tags them
        source=`inferred`.
      - Runs the full classify -> pick-primary -> add-constraints/
        extensions -> validate -> emit pipeline when the brief came
        from legacy migration (source=`inferred` primary) or omitted
        targeting entirely.
      - Degrades gracefully when seller-side discovery is offline
        (expected in this bead -- §8/§9/§11 activate it).

    Args:
        brief: The validated `CampaignBrief` from ingestion.
        agent: Optional pre-built agent (tests inject a verbose=False
