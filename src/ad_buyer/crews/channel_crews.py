"""Channel Specialist Crews for inventory research and booking.

This module defines the four channel-specialist crews (branding, mobile,
CTV, performance). Each crew factory accepts an optional audience plan,
which is rendered into the research task description so the channel
agents can target inventory accordingly.

Audience plan input shapes (proposal §5.3, bead ar-5y8v / §19):

  - Typed `AudiencePlan` (preferred): the new shape produced by the
    Audience Planner's reasoning loop. Carries primary + constraints +
    extensions + exclusions, each as `AudienceRef` with type tag,
    taxonomy, version, source, and (for agentic) compliance context.
  - Legacy dict: the older shape produced by `deal_booking_flow.py`'s
    `_create_audience_plan()` helper -- free-text demographics, interest
    lists, signal-type strings, etc. Accepted for backward compatibility
    with callers that have not yet migrated to the typed model.
  - None: no audience targeting; the audience-context block is omitted.

The single `_format_audience_context` entry point dispatches on input
type and renders the appropriate markdown.

# the construction. Each `create_*_crew` is now a thin delegate. Public
# signatures are unchanged so existing callers (CampaignPipeline,
# BuyerDealFlow, direct invocation tests) are unaffected.

# Planner upstream — the Research Agent here operates on inventory only.
