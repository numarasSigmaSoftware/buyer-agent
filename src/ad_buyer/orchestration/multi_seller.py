"""Multi-seller deal orchestration for Campaign Automation.

Coordinates the multi-seller flow described in the Campaign Automation
Strategic Plan, Section 7.2:

  1. Discover sellers via agent registry
  2. Request quotes from qualifying sellers in parallel
  3. Normalize and rank quotes using QuoteNormalizer
  4. Select optimal deals within budget constraints
  5. Book selected deals through the deals API

This module is the core of Campaign Automation's "shop the market"
capability.  It enables the buyer agent to simultaneously contact
multiple sellers, compare pricing on an apples-to-apples basis, and
book the best deals for a campaign channel.

Integration points:
  - RegistryClient (buyer-f8l): seller discovery
  - DealsClient (buyer-hu7): quote requests and deal booking
  - QuoteNormalizer (buyer-lae): cross-seller quote comparison
  - EventBus (buyer-ppi): event emission at each stage

        """Pre-flight a seller's capabilities, degrade the plan, then book.

        Implements proposal §5.7 layer 1+2 and composes with layer 3
        (the existing retry-on-rejection path):

        1. Call `capability_client.discover_capabilities(seller_url)` to
           get the seller's `audience_capabilities` (cached up to 1h,
           honoring `Cache-Control: max-age`).
        2. Run `degrade_plan_for_seller(plan, capabilities)` to produce
           a degraded plan + structured log of what was stripped.
        3. Apply `audience_strictness`: if any role marked "required"
           was dropped, raise `_SellerIncompatibleForCampaign` so the
           caller marks the seller incompatible. Otherwise proceed with
           the degraded plan.
        4. Delegate to `_book_with_audience_retry` with the degraded plan.
           If the seller still rejects (e.g., the cache was stale and
           the seller's caps tightened), the §12 retry path catches it
           and applies a second degradation pass against the seller's
           structured rejection.

        Audit-trail emissions (§13a):

        - One `EVENT_PREFLIGHT_CACHE` event per call with the cache
          status, seller, and capability summary.
        - One `EVENT_DEGRADATION` event when the pre-flight degraded
          the plan (separate from the retry's own degradation event).

        Args:
            client: Per-seller `DealsClient`.
            quote_id / seller_id: Booking identifiers.
            seller_url: Seller's base URL for capability discovery.
            audience_plan: Original plan from the campaign.
            audience_strictness: Per-role strictness policy.

        Returns:
            (deal_response, combined_degradation_log). The combined log
            stitches together pre-flight + retry-time entries so the
            caller's audit surface sees both.

        Raises:
            _SellerIncompatibleForCampaign: When pre-flight degradation
                strips a role marked "required" in the strictness
                policy, or when `degrade_plan_for_seller` cannot keep a
                primary at all.
