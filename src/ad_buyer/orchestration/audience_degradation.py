"""Buyer-side capability negotiation: `degrade_plan_for_seller`.

Implements proposal §5.7 layer 2 (graceful degradation) and the retry-side
of layer 3 (forward-compatible structured rejection):

> degrade_plan_for_seller(plan, caps):
>   if not caps.agentic.supported:
>     drop refs of type=agentic from plan, log entry per drop
>   if not caps.supports_extensions:
>     drop all extensions, log
>   if not caps.supports_constraints:
>     drop all constraints, log
>   if not caps.supports_exclusions:
>     drop all exclusions, log
>   if caps.contextual_taxonomy_versions doesn't include plan's contextual
>       ref version:
>     log "needs IAB Mapper" -- drop or attempt mapping (drop for now)
>   if caps.standard_taxonomy_versions doesn't include plan's standard ref
>       version:
>     log "version mismatch" -- drop or warn
>   if remaining plan has no primary:
>     raise CannotFulfillPlan(reason)
>   return degraded_plan, log

The function takes a plan and a capabilities object and returns a degraded
plan plus a structured `DegradationLog` (list of entries) the orchestrator
uses for the audit trail (§13a) and rationale append. Composes with bead
§13's pre-flight integration (the two together implement full capability
negotiation per §5.7).

A second helper, `synthesize_capabilities_from_unsupported`, derives a
downgraded `SellerAudienceCapabilities` from the seller's structured
`{"error": "audience_plan_unsupported", "unsupported": [...]}` rejection.
The orchestrator's retry-on-rejection path uses it to figure out which
parts of the plan to drop before retrying once.

Bead: ar-0w48 (proposal §5.7 layer 2 + §6 row 12).
