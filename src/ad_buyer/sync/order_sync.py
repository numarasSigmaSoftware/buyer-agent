"""Order sync service for pulling seller order state into the buyer's local DB.

Provides both single-order and bulk sync methods. The sync is
event-driven (on demand) or can be called periodically.

The buyer always trusts the seller as the source of truth for order
status and audit trail. The local copy enables the buyer to:
- Check order status without depending on seller API availability
- Query audit trails locally for reporting
- Support offline/degraded-mode operation
